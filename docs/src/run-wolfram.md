# Symbolic computation

## Overview
The main topic of this page is to give a proof of the main theorem of our thesis.

[Main theorem here]

The proof is too hard to calculate by hand, so we wrote code to solve this problem by Wolfram language.

## Prerequisite
The wolfram code is for proof of the main theorem of my theory.
So, you don't need part if you just want to make a surface model.

* [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/)
* [Wolfram Language kernel for Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter)

## How to use
There are two `ipynb` files for main theorem:

* `MainTheorem (simplified by Navier-Bernoulli hypothesis).ipynb`
    Easy, but incomplete because its hypothesis is too strong.
* `MainTheorem (general).ipynb`
    Difficut, but complete proof.
