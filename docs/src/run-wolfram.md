# [Symbolic computation](@id symbolic_computation)

There are two `.ipynb` files in [ElasticSurfaceEmbedding-wolfram](https://github.com/hyrodium/ElasticSurfaceEmbedding-wolfram) repository.

* `MainTheorem.ipynb`
* `AnalyticSolution.ipynb`

These files are used for some symbolic computation, so you can skip this part if you just want to make a surface model.
The following contents describes the rule of these files.

Please install the following software in your environment.

* [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/)
* [Wolfram Language kernel for Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter)

## Main theorems
There are two theorems in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06372).

!!! info "Theorem.  Approximation of Strain"
    In the range of sufficiently small breadth ``B`` of the curved piece, the piece is in an approximately ``u^1``-directional uniaxial stress state at each point, and the principal strain can be approximated as
    ```math
    E^{\langle 0 \rangle}_{11} \approx \frac{1}{2}K_{[0]}B^2\left(r^2-\frac{1}{3}\right), \quad E^{\langle 0 \rangle}_{22} \approx -\nu E^{\langle 0 \rangle}_{11}
    ```
    where ``K_{[0]}`` is the Gaussian curvature along the center curve ``C_{[0]}`` of the reference state ``M_{[0]}``, ``r`` is a normalized breadth-directional coordinate (``âˆ’1 \le r \le 1``). 

!!! info "Theorem.  Approximation of Embedding"
    Let ``C_{[0]}`` be the center curve of ``M_{[0]}``, ``\kappa_{[0]}`` be its geodesic curvature, ``B`` be the breadth from center curve of ``M_{[0]}``. Similarly, let ``C_{[t]}`` be the center curve of ``M_{[t]}`` , ``\kappa_{[t]}`` be its planer curvature. If the breadth ``B`` is sufficiently small, then the following approximation is satisfied.
    ```math
    g_{[t]}|_C \approx g_{[0]}|_C, \quad \kappa_{[t]} \approx \kappa_{[0]}.
    ```

The proof is too hard to calculate by hand, so we wrote code to solve this problem by Wolfram language.

## Analytic solutions
There are analytic solutions for some specific problem.
