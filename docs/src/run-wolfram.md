# [Symbolic computation](@id symbolic_computation)

The wolfram code in this repository is for the proof of the main theorem of my paper.
So, if you just want to make a surface model, you can skip this part.

## Installation

* [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/)
* [Wolfram Language kernel for Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter)

Clone my wolfram scripts from [ElasticSurfaceEmbedding-wolfram](https://github.com/hyrodium/ElasticSurfaceEmbedding-wolfram).

## Overview
The main topic of this page is to give a proof of the main theorem of our thesis.

[Main theorem here]

The proof is too hard to calculate by hand, so we wrote code to solve this problem by Wolfram language.

## How to use
There are two `ipynb` files for the main theorem:

* `MainTheorem (simplified by Navier-Bernoulli hypothesis).ipynb`
    Easy, but incomplete because its hypothesis is too strong.
* `MainTheorem (general).ipynb`
    Difficult, but complete proof.

### Simplified

### General
