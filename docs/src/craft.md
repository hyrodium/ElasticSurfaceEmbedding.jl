## Question: How can I make the model?
You can:
* Download [the paraboloid paper strip data](https://github.com/hyrodium/ElasticSurfaceEmbedding.jl/tree/develop/craft), and cut by scissors.
    * It would be hard, but [not impossible](https://hyrodium.tumblr.com/post/178719972384).
* Download [the paraboloid paper strip data](https://github.com/hyrodium/ElasticSurfaceEmbedding.jl/tree/develop/craft), and cut by laser cutting machine.
    * I use [Beambox by FLUX.inc](https://flux3dp.com/beambox/), btw.
* [Compute the shape of paper strip](@ref numerical_computation), instead of downloading the paraboloid.
    * This needs setup for Julia environment.
* Buy already cut pieces of paper at [Booth](https://hyrodium.booth.pm/).
    * Ships from Japan (i.e. from my house).
