# Elastic Surface Embedding

## TL;DR
You can make a *holdable* smooth surface model with this repository.

The main part of this project is how to determine a planer shape from a strip on curved surface.
In mathematics, this mapping is called "embedding".
We determined the embedding by minimizing its elastic strain energy.
This is the meaning of "Elastic Surface Embedding".

## Overview: How to make a surface model
### step 1 : Define a shape of surface (and split into strips)
The definition must consists of parametric mapping and its domain.
For example, a paraboloid can be parametrized as below.

```math
\begin{aligned}
\bm{p}_{[0]}(u^1, u^2)
&= \begin{pmatrix}
u^1 \\
u^2 \\
(u^1)^2 + (u^2)^2
\end{pmatrix} \\
D
&= [-1,1]\times[-1,1]
\end{aligned}
```

The domain ``D`` will be split into ``D_i``.

```math
\begin{aligned}
D_i
&= [-1,1]\times\left[\frac{i-1}{10},\frac{i}{10}\right] & (i=1,\dots,10)
\end{aligned}
```

### step 2 : Numerical analysis
This is the main part.
Split the surface into pieces, and compute the Eucledian embedding.
For more information, read [this document](/Julia).
The image below is a result for the domain D_1.

### step 3 : Edit on vector graphics editor
The output files are svg format.
After editing the svg files, you can print the graphics or cut papers by laser cutting machine.

### step 4 : Craft a paper model
This is the final step.
Cut papers into strips, and weave them.

Download the [Paraboloid example](/Example/Paraboloid.pdf) and [make your own surface model](Craft).
Laser cutting machine is useful, but it's not necessary.
