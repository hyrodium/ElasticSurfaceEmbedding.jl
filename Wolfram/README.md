# Wolfram code for Elastic Surface Embedding

## Overview
The main topic of this page is to give a proof of the main theorem of our thesis.

[Main theorem here]

The proof is too hard to calculate by hand, so we wrote code to solve this problem by Wolfram language.


## Prerequisite
The wolfram code is for proof of the main theorem of my theory.
So, you don't need part if you just want to make a surface model.
